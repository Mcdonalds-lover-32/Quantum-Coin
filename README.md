Mining:

Users can mine Quantum Coins automatically at a fixed rate, for example, 0.0001 coins per second.
The mining process updates the user's balance in real-time.
Selling Quantum Coin:

Users can sell their mined coins for a unique redeemable code.
These codes allow users to transfer their coins to others or store them for future use.
Redeeming Codes:

Codes generated from selling can be redeemed by other users, transferring the specified Quantum Coin amount to their balance.
Codes are protected against multiple redemptions using a verification mechanism.
USD Conversion:

The system calculates and displays the projected USD value of the user's Quantum Coins using a preset conversion rate (e.g., 0.000015 USD per 0.0001 Quantum Coin).
Anti-Tampering Measures:

Features like disabling browser developer tools and clearing the user's balance if tampering is detected ensure a fair and secure mining environment.
Live Updates:

Mining rates, balances, and conversion values update dynamically to keep the user informed.
